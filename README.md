Tensor methods are very effective in modeling and extracting knowledge from multi-aspect data. Spatiotemporal data (e.g., trajectory data, satellite image data, etc) are inherently multi-aspect and can be expressed as tensors. In this project, we will explore the power of tensor methods for modeling and mining spatiotemporal data.
